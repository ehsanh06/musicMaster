## Synopsis

This is a _React_ built project that specialises in using the _Spotify API_ to return top music hits from the searched artist. 

## Motivation

The project was created to show my competency and understanding for not only using React and other various packages using npm, but to show that I can show demonstration of using other API's.

## Installation

Simply just clone or fork this repository, and run the following command:

> npm i
> This will ensure every package for this project is up to date.


## API Reference

Due to Spotify updating things their end, you will need an **access_token** to actually use the API. Below are the links which will help you use Spotify's API and to also sign up for Spotify Developer.
